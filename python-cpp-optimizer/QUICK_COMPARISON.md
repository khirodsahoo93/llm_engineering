|---------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| **Background** | Purple gradient | Custom Python→C++ image |
| **Load Time** | Instant ⚡ | Fast (image load) |
| **File Size** | ~50KB | ~50KB + image |
| **Setup Complexity** | Zero setup needed ✅ | Need image file |
| **HF Deployment** | Drop & go | Need to upload image + edit path |

## 🚀 Test Both Locally

```bash
# Test gradient version
APP_PASSWORD=demo123 python3 app.py
# Open: http://127.0.0.1:7860

# Stop it (Ctrl+C), then test image version
APP_PASSWORD=demo123 python3 app_with_image.py
# Open: http://127.0.0.1:7860
```

## 📊 Current Status
