## Key Code Patterns

### Model Fine-tuning Setup
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification
import torch

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
model_name = "distilbert-base-uncased"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
    model_name, 
    num_labels=1  # For regression
)

# Prepare training data
def prepare_dataset(data):
    inputs = tokenizer(
        data['descriptions'],
        truncation=True,
        padding=True,
        max_length=512
    )
    return {
        'input_ids': inputs['input_ids'],
        'attention_mask': inputs['attention_mask'],
        'labels': data['prices']
    }
```

### Training Loop
```python
from transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer
import torch

# Training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./price-prediction-model',
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=16,
    warmup_steps=500,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    logging_dir='./logs',
    logging_steps=10,
    evaluation_strategy="steps",
    eval_steps=500,
    save_steps=1000,
)

# Create trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
)

# Train model
trainer.train()
```

### Model Inference
```python
def predict_price(description, model, tokenizer):
    # Tokenize input
    inputs = tokenizer(
        description,
        truncation=True,
        padding=True,
        max_length=512,
        return_tensors="pt"
    )
    
    # Make prediction
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model(**inputs)
        predicted_price = outputs.logits.item()
    
    return predicted_price
```

### Data Preprocessing
```python
def preprocess_data(dataset):
    processed_data = []
    
    for item in dataset:
        if item['price'] is not None and item['price'] > 0:
            # Combine title and description
            text = f"{item['title']} {item['description']}"
            
            processed_data.append({
                'description': text,
                'price': item['price']
            })
    
    return processed_data
```

## Common Interview Questions & Answers

**Q: "Why did you choose fine-tuning over training from scratch?"**
A: "Fine-tuning leverages pre-trained knowledge, requires less data, trains faster, and often achieves better performance. For text-based tasks, pre-trained models already understand language structure, so we only need to adapt them to the specific task."

**Q: "How did you handle the large dataset for training?"**
A: "I used data streaming, batch processing, and memory-efficient data loaders. I also implemented progressive training where I started with a subset and gradually increased the dataset size as the model improved."

**Q: "What challenges did you face with price prediction from text?"**
A: "Price prediction is inherently difficult because many factors aren't captured in text descriptions. I addressed this by feature engineering, using product categories, and implementing robust validation to handle outliers and edge cases."

**Q: "How did you ensure the model would work in production?"**
A: "I implemented comprehensive testing, created inference pipelines, added error handling, and monitored model performance. I also considered latency requirements and implemented efficient tokenization and batching for real-time predictions."
