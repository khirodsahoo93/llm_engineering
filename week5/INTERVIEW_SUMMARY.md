### 5. **Business Applications**
- **Company Knowledge Base**: Employee and product information systems
- **Contract Analysis**: Legal document querying and analysis
- **Customer Support**: Automated responses based on company knowledge
- **Internal Documentation**: Quick access to company policies and procedures

## Key Code Patterns

### Knowledge Base Loading
```python
import glob
import os

context = {}

# Load employee documents
employees = glob.glob("knowledge-base/employees/*")
for employee in employees:
    name = employee.split(' ')[-1][:-3]  # Extract name from filename
    with open(employee, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        doc = f.read()
    context[name] = doc

# Load product documents
products = glob.glob("knowledge-base/products/*")
for product in products:
    name = product.split(os.sep)[-1][:-3]
    with open(product, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        doc = f.read()
    context[name] = doc
```

### Context Retrieval
```python
def get_relevant_context(message):
    relevant_context = []
    for context_title, context_details in context.items():
        if context_title.lower() in message.lower():
            relevant_context.append(context_details)
    return relevant_context
```

### RAG Query Processing
```python
def answer_question(question):
    # Get relevant context
    relevant_docs = get_relevant_context(question)
    
    # Create context-aware prompt
    context_text = "\n\n".join(relevant_docs)
    
    system_message = "You are an expert in answering accurate questions about Insurellm, the Insurance Tech company. Give brief, accurate answers. If you don't know the answer, say so. Do not make anything up if you haven't been provided with relevant context."
    
    user_prompt = f"Context: {context_text}\n\nQuestion: {question}"
    
    # Generate answer
    response = openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": system_message},
            {"role": "user", "content": user_prompt}
        ]
    )
    
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

### Gradio RAG Interface
```python
import gradio as gr

def rag_chat(message, history):
    # Get relevant context
    relevant_docs = get_relevant_context(message)
    
    if not relevant_docs:
        return "I don't have relevant information to answer that question."
    
    # Generate answer with context
    answer = answer_question(message)
    return answer

interface = gr.ChatInterface(
    fn=rag_chat,
    title="Insurellm Knowledge Assistant",
    description="Ask questions about our company, employees, and products"
)
```

## Common Interview Questions & Answers

**Q: "What are the advantages of RAG over fine-tuning for knowledge-based applications?"**
A: "RAG allows for real-time knowledge updates without retraining, handles multiple knowledge sources easily, and provides source attribution. It's also more cost-effective for domain-specific knowledge and can be updated incrementally."

**Q: "How do you ensure the retrieved context is relevant to the user's question?"**
A: "I implement keyword matching, context scoring, and use the LLM to evaluate relevance. I also provide multiple context sources and let the model synthesize information from different documents when appropriate."

**Q: "What challenges did you face with document processing and encoding?"**
A: "Different documents can have various encodings, special characters, and formats. I implemented robust encoding detection, error handling for corrupted files, and text cleaning to ensure consistent processing across different document types."

**Q: "How do you handle cases where no relevant context is found?"**
A: "I implement graceful degradation by clearly stating when information isn't available, suggesting related topics, and providing guidance on where users might find the information. I also log these cases for potential knowledge base improvements."
