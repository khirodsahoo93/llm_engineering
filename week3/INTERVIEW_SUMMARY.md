## Key Code Patterns

### Colab Environment Setup
```python
# Check GPU availability
!nvidia-smi

# Install packages
!pip install transformers torch

# Mount Google Drive
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

### GPU Utilization
```python
import torch

# Check if CUDA is available
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
print(f"Using device: {device}")

# Move model to GPU
model = model.to(device)
```

### File Management
```python
# Upload files
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()

# Download files
files.download('output.txt')

# Access Google Drive files
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/data.csv')
```

### Resource Monitoring
```python
# Monitor GPU memory
!nvidia-smi --query-gpu=memory.used,memory.total --format=csv

# Monitor system resources
!free -h
!df -h
```

## Common Interview Questions & Answers

**Q: "What are the advantages of using Google Colab for AI development?"**
A: "Colab provides free GPU access, which is crucial for training large models. It also offers easy collaboration, integrated storage, and eliminates the need for local hardware setup. However, it has session time limits and resource constraints."

**Q: "How do you manage large datasets in Colab?"**
A: "I use Google Drive integration for persistent storage, implement efficient data loading with generators, and consider data preprocessing to reduce memory usage. For very large datasets, I might use streaming or chunked processing."

**Q: "What are the limitations of Colab's free tier?"**
A: "Free tier has session time limits (12 hours), limited RAM and disk space, and no guaranteed GPU access. For production work, Colab Pro provides longer sessions, better GPUs, and more reliable resource allocation."

**Q: "How do you ensure your work persists in Colab?"**
A: "I save important work to Google Drive, use version control with Git, and implement checkpointing for long-running processes. I also export notebooks and save model weights regularly."
