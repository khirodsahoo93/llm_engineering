## Key Code Patterns

### Modal Function Definition
```python
import modal

# Create Modal app
app = modal.App("ai-agents")

# Define image with dependencies
image = modal.Image.debian_slim().pip_install([
    "openai",
    "anthropic",
    "gradio"
])

# Define a Modal function
@app.function(image=image)
def process_request(input_data):
    # AI processing logic
    result = ai_agent.process(input_data)
    return result

# Define function with specific region
@app.function(image=image, region="eu")
def process_europe_request(input_data):
    # EU-specific processing
    return process_request(input_data)
```

### Multi-Agent System
```python
class AgentSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = {
            'researcher': ResearchAgent(),
            'analyzer': AnalysisAgent(),
            'writer': WritingAgent(),
            'reviewer': ReviewAgent()
        }
    
    def process_complex_task(self, task):
        # Decompose task
        subtasks = self.decompose_task(task)
        
        # Process with different agents
        results = []
        for subtask in subtasks:
            agent_type = self.select_agent(subtask)
            result = self.agents[agent_type].process(subtask)
            results.append(result)
        
        # Combine results
        final_result = self.combine_results(results)
        return final_result
```

### Agent Communication
```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, name, capabilities):
        self.name = name
        self.capabilities = capabilities
        self.message_queue = []
    
    def send_message(self, target_agent, message):
        target_agent.receive_message(self.name, message)
    
    def receive_message(self, sender, message):
        self.message_queue.append((sender, message))
    
    def process_messages(self):
        while self.message_queue:
            sender, message = self.message_queue.pop(0)
            self.handle_message(sender, message)
```

### Modal Deployment
```python
# Deploy function to Modal
with app.run():
    # Local execution
    result = process_request.local("test input")
    
    # Remote execution
    result = process_request.remote("test input")
    
    # Batch processing
    results = process_request.map(["input1", "input2", "input3"])
```

### Agent Orchestration
```python
@app.function(image=image)
def orchestrate_agents(task_description):
    # Initialize agent system
    agent_system = AgentSystem()
    
    # Process task through multiple agents
    result = agent_system.process_complex_task(task_description)
    
    return {
        'task': task_description,
        'result': result,
        'agents_used': agent_system.get_agent_usage()
    }
```

## Common Interview Questions & Answers

**Q: "What are the advantages of multi-agent systems over single large models?"**
A: "Multi-agent systems offer specialization, parallel processing, fault tolerance, and easier maintenance. Each agent can be optimized for specific tasks, and the system can continue working even if individual agents fail."

**Q: "How do you handle communication and coordination between agents?"**
A: "I implement message queues, event-driven communication, and clear protocols for agent interaction. I also use state management to maintain context across agent interactions and implement error handling for communication failures."

**Q: "Why did you choose Modal for deployment?"**
A: "Modal provides serverless computing with automatic scaling, pay-per-use pricing, and easy deployment. It's particularly good for AI workloads because it handles the infrastructure complexity and allows focus on the AI logic."

**Q: "How do you ensure the multi-agent system is reliable and maintainable?"**
A: "I implement comprehensive logging, monitoring, and error handling. Each agent has clear responsibilities and interfaces, making the system modular and easier to debug. I also use version control and testing to ensure reliability."
