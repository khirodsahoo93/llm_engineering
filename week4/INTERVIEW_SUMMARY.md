## Key Code Patterns

### Code Generation Prompt
```python
system_message = "You are an assistant that reimplements Python code in high performance C++ for an M1 Mac. "
system_message += "Respond only with C++ code; use comments sparingly and do not provide any explanation other than occasional comments. "
system_message += "The C++ response needs to produce an identical output in the fastest possible time."

def user_prompt_for(python):
    user_prompt = "Rewrite this Python code in C++ with the fastest possible implementation that produces identical output in the least time. "
    user_prompt += f"Python code:\n{python}"
    return user_prompt
```

### C++ Compilation and Execution
```python
def execute_cpp(cpp_code):
    # Write C++ code to file
    with open("optimized.cpp", "w") as f:
        f.write(cpp_code)
    
    # Compile C++ code
    compile_result = subprocess.run(
        ["clang++", "-O3", "-std=c++17", "optimized.cpp", "-o", "optimized"],
        capture_output=True, text=True
    )
    
    if compile_result.returncode != 0:
        return f"Compilation error: {compile_result.stderr}"
    
    # Execute compiled code
    exec_result = subprocess.run(
        ["./optimized"], capture_output=True, text=True
    )
    
    return exec_result.stdout
```

### Multi-Model Integration
```python
def optimize_code(python_code, model_choice):
    if model_choice == "GPT-4o":
        return call_gpt4o(python_code)
    elif model_choice == "Claude-3.5-Sonnet":
        return call_claude(python_code)
    # ... other models
```

### Gradio Interface
```python
import gradio as gr

def process_code(python_code, model_choice):
    # Generate C++ code
    cpp_code = optimize_code(python_code, model_choice)
    
    # Execute and validate
    python_output = execute_python(python_code)
    cpp_output = execute_cpp(cpp_code)
    
    return cpp_code, python_output, cpp_output

interface = gr.Interface(
    fn=process_code,
    inputs=[
        gr.Textbox(label="Python Code", lines=10),
        gr.Dropdown(choices=["GPT-4o", "Claude-3.5-Sonnet"])
    ],
    outputs=[
        gr.Textbox(label="Generated C++ Code", lines=10),
        gr.Textbox(label="Python Output"),
        gr.Textbox(label="C++ Output")
    ]
)
```

## Common Interview Questions & Answers

**Q: "How do you ensure the generated C++ code is correct and safe?"**
A: "I implement multiple validation layers: compilation checking, output comparison with original Python code, and runtime error handling. I also use specific prompts that emphasize correctness and provide clear error messages for debugging."

**Q: "What are the performance benefits of C++ over Python for this use case?"**
A: "C++ offers significant performance improvements through compiled execution, better memory management, and optimization opportunities. For computationally intensive tasks, we often see 10-100x speed improvements, though the exact benefit depends on the algorithm."

**Q: "How do you handle security concerns with code execution?"**
A: "I use subprocess isolation, input validation, timeout mechanisms, and resource limits. I also implement sandboxing where possible and validate that the generated code doesn't contain dangerous operations like file system access or network calls."

**Q: "What challenges did you face with multi-model integration?"**
A: "Different models have varying APIs, response formats, and capabilities. I had to standardize the interface, handle different error types, and implement fallback mechanisms. I also had to consider cost and performance trade-offs between different providers."
